Steps for setting up the environment:

This uses the files from https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=352505

k4:
Step 1:
-Install jailbreak by copying these files to the root of the kindle user storage (over ssh this would be /mnt/us)
data.tar.gz
diagnostic_logs
ENABLE_DIAGS
-go to settings and then restart

Step 2: 
-put the usbnetwork binary into the kindle root folder:
Update_usbnetwork_0.57.N_k4_install.bin
-go to "settings" -> "install update"

Step 3:
-copy the kual file to the documents folder. I forget which it is but I copy both and then delete the one that doesnt work:
KUAL-KDK-1.0.azw2
KUAL-KDK-2.0.azw2

-copy the MKK file to the root folder (for me it is Update_mkk-20141129-k4-ALL_install.bin)
-copy helper extension (/extensions)
-copy the MRinstaller to /extensions , and the mrpackages folder to the root of the kindle
-copy the usbnetworking folder to the mrpackages folder

step 4:
-run Kual from the main page, go to page 2 of helper and tell it to install mrpackage

step 5:
-copy python 3 (Update_python3_0.14.N_k4_install.bin) to mrinstaller and install this in the same way

step 6:
-prevent OTA updates from helper+
-from usbnetworking, enable ssh on boot, toggle network.

I then connect it to wifi and i check which ip it is on by running "python -m http.server" and then connecting to it from the experimental browser, for example@
Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ...
::ffff:192.168.0.200 - - [04/May/2023 02:03:51] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
          ^ the kindle's ip

I can then ssh to the kindle.
The password is "root" with the root password. You are going to need to find this online via your serial number. 

Please note that in the events where this login does not work, I connected via usb networking (you'll need to read up on getting the network adapter installed) and then instead of sshing to it I telnet to it, and then use passwd to change the password to something I can remember. DO NOT LOSE THIS PASSWORD. DO NOT LOSE THIS PASSWORD. WRITE IT DOWN. DO NOT LOSE THIS PASSWORD. I can then ssh or scp to it.
